    <h1>DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION: THIS DOCUMENT HAS <em>NOT</em> YET BEEN ADOPTED, AND IS NOT BINDING IN ANY WAY.</h1>

    <p>
      Software Carpentry always has been, and always will be, an open
      project, but we do need to protect its unique identity (its "brand")
      to ensure that when people see our name or logo, they know what it
      is being used for.  We want to help you to make fair use of our name
      and logo so we have prepared some guidelines to explain what uses
      are acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "Software Carpentry" word mark and the Software Carpentry logo:
    </p>

    <p>
      are both registered trademarks.  We will refer to them together as
      the "Software Carpentry Marks".
