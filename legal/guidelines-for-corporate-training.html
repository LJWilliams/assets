      Our material is all Creative Commons licensed, so anyone who
      wants to use it for corporate training can do so, and doesn't
      need our permission. The only thing they *do* need our
      permission for is using our name and logo, since they're
      trademarked. We're happy to give that permission if we've
      certified the instructor [1] and have a chance to double-check
      the content [2].  Personally, I think it would be great if
      people could earn a living from this in the way that many people
      earn a living from open source software, so if you'd like to
      give it a try, please get in touch.

      [1] "Certified the instructor" will usually mean "has earned an
      instructor's badge".

    <p>
      [2] "Double-check the content" because we've already had one
      instance of someone calling something "Software Carpentry" when
      it had nothing to do with what we usually teach.
