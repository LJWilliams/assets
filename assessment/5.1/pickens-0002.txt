From Cait Pickens:

My suggestions:

(1) Define learning objectives first (best practices in [1], [2],
    [3]). [4] is my blog-letter to Greg about learning
    objectives. Greg already has a lot of SWC LOs by the way, so these
    need not be developed from scratch. We will require explicit
    learning objectives for each major lesson of SWC. Document them
    clearly. Something like this...

    Lesson: Programming with Python

    LO1: Students will be able to parse multiple text files and store
         them in appropriate data structures (including lists,
         dictionaries, and sets).

    LO2: Students will be able to perform statistical analyses on
         their text-based datasets using Python libraries (such as...).

***Don't use words like "know" and "understand" in LOs. They are far
too vague to be able to measure/quantify***

(2) Think about what knowledge students must demonstrate in order to
    show competently achieving those learning objectives.

    In order to measure LO1 above, we would need to see if students
    can read in a file and parse it. We would also have to test their
    understanding of when to use different data structures and how to
    build them. Can these all be done in one question? Probably
    not. But we want a *short* and *non intimidating* assessment, so
    we need as few questions as possible.

(3) Once you have all of that, start developing questions. Start with
    Greg's reading group. He has them writing multiple choice
    questions in a thoughtful manner. These would probably be a good
    place to get ideas and some questions to tweak/refine.

    How would a student actually *show* knowledge about parsing a
    file?  What would a question look like? For a concept inventory,
    we need multiple choice. What would good wrong answers be?

(4) In the assessment folder in the repo, start a series of files that
    have all of this data documented clearly (in case it needs to be
    modified over time, and so that it is easy to write papers about
    all this work later down the road). The docs could be something
    like assess_python.md, assess_versioncontrol.md, etc. They would
    contain the learning objectives, the proposed method for measuring
    the LOs, and ideas for questions for each LO. It would be really
    easy then for people to go in and add / refine questions for each
    specific LO.
