    <h1>Software Carpentry for Women in Science &amp; Engineering</h1>

    <p>
      This summer <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> and
      <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">Software
      Carpentry</a> are hosting a software skills boot camp for 120
      women in science and engineering in Boston. We are seeking
      sponsorship from companies and others who would like to help
      make this happen.
    </p>

    <h2>What's A Boot Camp?</h2>

    <p>
      A Software Carpentry boot camp is a two-day workshop which
      teaches scientists how to write, test and manage research
      software.  Topics covered include the Unix shell, version
      control, basic Python programming, testing, and debugging.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boot camps are example-driven and alternate short tutorials with
      hands-on practical exercises. Since learners work on their own
      laptops, they leave with a set of working tools they can use
      immediately to increase their productivity and improve
      confidence in their results.

	Like most psychology students, I got no formal training in
	computational methods during my undergrad or graduate
	program. This meant that I was effectively cut off from the tool I
	was using and pessimistic about my chances of ever mastering
	it. Software Carpentry demystified programming for me and also
	gave me a solid background in software development practices. I
	now use tools that I never would have considered before taking the
	course, and have even accepted a postdoc in a computation-heavy
	lab, which would have been out of the question. My only regret is
	that I wasn't able to take this course earlier in my degree!

    <h2>Why A Boot Camp For Women?</h2>

    <p>
      After peaking at 37% in the mid-1980s, the number of women
      working in computing has steadily declined: less than 12% of
      computer science degrees were awarded to women in 2010-11.
      Separate figures for scientific computing aren't available, but
      there is clearly a similar imbalance, and Software Carpentry is
      committed to helping address it.  This boot camp will empower
      women in research by showing them how to wield powerful
      computational tools, and also give them a chance to cultivate a
      community of peers.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is The Funding For?</h2>

    <p>
      NumFOCUS and Software Carpentry are non-profit organizations,
      and all of our instructors are volunteers. Donations to the
      NumFOCUS Software Carpentry Boot Camp for Women will cover the
      cost of travel and lodging for instructors, as well as
      incidental expenses such as refreshments.
