### Checklist for SWC Boot Camp Instructors

#### Before
- Book your transport to the boot camp location and your lodging. (Save your
	receipts!)
- Use material from SWC website and elsewhere to prepare your session(s)
- Prepare the materials you'll need for your session(s)
  - data sets
	- cheat sheets
	- repositories
	- etc.
	- etherpad notepads

      You can set up as many etherpad notepads as you like. Stick to a sensible
			naming convention (e.g., <code>bootcampname-date-lesson</code>) so we can
			track down the etherpads later.  Or create an account on
			etherpad.mozilla.org to automatically track the pads you create. 
- Make material, exercises and sample data available to attendees and other
	instructors
- Familiarise yourself with the other instructors' materials, in case someone
	can't make it to the boot camp
- Set up the boot camp software on your laptop


#### After

- Send transport and lodging receipts to SWC admin or the boot camp hosts
- Write a blog post, post to the discuss@lists.software-carpentry.org list or
	send a report to SWC admin
