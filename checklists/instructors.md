### Checklist for SWC Boot Camp Instructors

#### Before
- Book transport to the boot camp location, and lodging. (Save your
	receipts!)
- Prepare your session(s)
- Review Mike Jackson's <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-01-08-top-tips-instructors-software-carpentry-boot-camp">Top Tips for instructors</a>
- Prepare the materials you'll need:
    - data sets
	  - cheat sheets
	  - repositories
	  - etc.
	  - etherpad notepads

        You can set up as many etherpad notepads as you like. Stick to a
				sensible naming convention (e.g.,
				<code>bootcampname-date-lesson</code>) so we can track down the
				etherpads later.  Or create an account on etherpad.mozilla.org to
				automatically track the pads you create. 

- Make supporting material, exercises and sample data available to attendees
	and other instructors
- Familiarise yourself with the other instructors' materials, in case someone 
	can't make it to the boot camp and you have to heroically step in
- Set up the boot camp software on your laptop

#### After

- Send transport and lodging receipts to SWC admin or the boot camp hosts
- Write a blog post, post to the discuss@lists.software-carpentry.org list or
	send a report to SWC admin
