## Checklist for Software Carpentry Boot Camp Organizers

### Before Boot Camp

#### Planning

- Find money to pay for instructors' travel and lodging expenses, if necessary
- Help SWC find instructors
- Work with SWC admin to pick a date

#### Initial Setup

- Decide whether the boot camp will be restricted to a particular population,
	or open to the public
- Decide whether the boot camp will be free, require a deposit (repaid if
	attendee is at the boot camp for both days) or have a small fee
- Book a room. It needs:
	- Front-facing tables so that attendees can watch an instructor and use
		 their laptop at the same time.
	- Space for mingling without tripping over cables and squeezing between
		chairs. Lecture theatres are not recommended as their banked floors and
		fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
	- High-speed wi-fi or network access that can withstand everyone using it at
		the same time
	- Power for all the computers
	- A microphone if the room's very big or has poor acoustics
	- Disabled access
	- Air-conditioning
- Decide how many spaces you will make available for the camp.
		(This will depend on the size of the room you can get.)
- Tell SWC admin:
    - the size of the room
	  - the address and room number
	  - the number of spaces
	  - the fee information

    ...so they can create an EventBrite registration page
- Advertise the boot camp
- Send out a pre-boot camp questionnaire to determine interest and level
  of participants' programming knowledge 
- Work with instructors and SWC admin to decide what material to cover
- Obtain supplies:
	- projector and spare bulb
	- MAC VGA adapter
	- an ample number of extension cables and power bars
	- red and green sticky notes or another <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/01/18/when-the-sticky-goes/">signalling device</a>
	- badges for instructors and helpers

#### Before

- Order coffee, pastries, or whatever other catering you are providing. Make
	sure there is a table to put food on.

#### The Week Before

- Request confirmation from attendees that they will be attending.
- Identify a suitable pub or bar for socialising after the first day.
- Ask if your instructors and helpers would like to go out for dinner.

#### The Day Before

- Check:
	- Will the building and the room be unlocked on the day of the event?
	- Is the room easy to find? (This will affect how many signs you put up the next day.)
	- Do you know where the bathrooms are?
	- Is there any noisy construction/cleaning going on and, if so, can you do something about it?
	- Is the projector working, and do you have a spare bulb?
	- Is the network or wi-fi working?
	- Have you set up network or wi-fi guest accounts?
	- Do you have a contact number for maintenance and technical support?
	- Have you double-checked with catering?
	- If you're not using EventBrite, have you emailed a reminder to everyone?
- Print out:
	- Attendance sheet
	- Photo release form (if necessary)
	- Feedback forms

#### On the first day

Before the boot camp begins:

- Put up signs directing attendees to the room.
- Give instructors and helpers their badges.
- Brief helpers on their role: mingle, answer questions, watch for body
	language, and help attendees.
- Make network connection instructions available on a hand-out or projector.
- Give everyone a few minutes to plug in, get on the network and settle in.
- Give everyone a red and a green sticky note.

As part of your welcome:

- Tell attendees 
  - who the instructors and helpers are and what they're there for
  - what Twitter hashtag you're using.
  - where the bathrooms and snacks are
- Circulate the attendance sheet and photo release form.

At the close of the last day

- Circulate feedback forms
- Remind attendees of online follow-up sessions
- Ask if any attendees are interested in being helpers or instructors at future
	boot camps. If so note down their contact details and forward them to
	Software Carpentry admin

The day after

- Send out a feedback questionnaire, if you have one
- Remind attendees about the online follow-up sessions
- Remind attendees to get in touch if they'd like to help or instruct at a future boot camp or to organise one at their institution.
- Write a blog post or report back to Software Carpentry about how it all went,
	both good and bad points - be honest!
