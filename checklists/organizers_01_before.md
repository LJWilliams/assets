## Checklist for Software Carpentry Boot Camp Organizers:

### Before Boot Camp:

#### Planning

- Find money to pay for instructors' travel and lodging expenses, if necessary
- Help SWC find instructors
- Pick a date
		The date will depend on many factors, including the availablility of
		instructors. If you hold the boot camp at a university, remember that the
		start of term works better the end of term (when exams are held), and the
		start of second (or subsequent) term works better for graduate students
		than the start of first term (the start of an academic year is already
		busy). In our experience mid-term breaks (reading weeks) have not worked
		well and there have been very high no-show rates.  
		
		You might consider scheduling a boot camp immediately before or after a
		conference. Not only will this give you a large audience, but it will also
		make the boot camp easier to run, because it's easier to teach attendees
		who are all from the same community.)
- Decide whether the boot camp will be closed or open
- Decide how many spaces you will make available for the camp
		(This will depend on the size of the room you can get.)
- Send out a pre-boot camp questionnaire to determine interest and level
  of participants' programming knowledge 
- Decide what material you want to cover

#### Two Weeks Before

- Send attendees setup information, and make it clear that they are expected to
	set up their computer before they attend the boot camp, and to email the
	organizers or SWC admin if they have a problem.

#### The Week Before

- Request confirmation from attendees that they will be attending.
- Remind attendees of the setup page.
- Send a pre-boot camp questionnaire, if you want to find any information out beforehand (e.g. their understanding of programming, languages they want to work with, their research backgrounds).
    Contact your instructors and ask them to make their material available and put any practical exercises on web pages so that attendees can refer to them during the boot camp. Data files or other useful information should also be added.
    Contact your helpers, see if they have any questions and ask them to arrive 10-15 minutes early so they can be briefed.
    Remind instructors and helpers to familiarise themselves with all the material (especially instructors, in case they end up covering for an instructor who has to pull out) and also to set up the boot camp software on their laptops too.
    Publish your materials online if you have not already done so.
    Identify a suitable pub or bar for socialising after the first day.
    Ask if your instructors and helpers would like to go out for dinner.

#### The Day Before

Is the building and the room going to be unlocked on the day of the event?
    Is the room clearly signposted?
    Do you know where the toilets are?
    Is there any noisy construction/cleaning going on and, if so, can you do something about it?
    Is the projector working, and do you have a spare bulb?
    Do you have a MAC VGA adapter?
    Do you have enough extension cables?
    Is the network or wi-fi working?
    Have you set up network or wi-fi guest accounts?
    Do you have a contact number for maintenance and technical support?
    Have you double-checked with catering?
    Have you emailed a reminder to everyone?
    Have you set up all the accounts, web sites and repositories you will need?
    Do you have red and green sticky notes?
    Do you have badges for instructors and helpers?
    Do you have an attendance sheet?
    Do you have a photo release form?
    Do you have a watering hole to socialise in after the first day?
    Have you arranged dinner for your instructors and helpers?
 On the first day

Before you welcome everyone:

    Put up any signs to the room.
    Give instructors and helpers their badges.
    Brief helpers on their role: mingle, answer questions and help attendees.
    Ensure that helpers are seated around the room.
    Give everyone a few minutes to plug-in, get on the network and settle in.

As part of your welcome:

    Tell the attendees who the instructors and helpers are, and explain what they're there for, and get them all to wave!
    Make network connection instructions available on a hand-out or projector.
    Tell everyone what Twitter hash tag you're using.
    Circulate the attendance sheet and photo release form.
    Give everyone a red and a green sticky note.
    And, you're off...

At the close of the last day

    Ask attendees for feedback.
    Collect the attendance sheet and photo release form.
    Remind attendees of online follow-up sessions.
    Ask if any attendees would be willing to act as helpers or instructors at future boot camps. If so note down their contact details and forward them to us or please ask them to contact us - we maintain a list of potential helpers and instructors which can help when organising future boot camps.

The day after

    Send out a feedback questionnaire, if you have one.
    Remind attendees about the online follow-up sessions.
    Remind attendees to get in touch if they'd like to help or instruct at a future boot camp or to organise one at their institution.
    Write a blog post about how it all went, both good and bad points - be honest!
